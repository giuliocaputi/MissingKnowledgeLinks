This is a project I did together with Francesco Braicovich at Bocconi Students for Machine Learning. 
Our algorithm builds a graph of all pages connected to an input web page, and uses Network Science techniques 
to identify knowledge that, although not employed in a certain field, might be, given the structure of the graph.
